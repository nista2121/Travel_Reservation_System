This projects are built with express html and angular Single Page Application. Either of these frameworks can be used to build the project. The similarity between them is that they both used JavaScript in the frontend. Angular used typescript, which still JavaScript but more focused on the data type, another similarity is that they all support the MVC pattern. 
Developer must follow the structure angular project should be build, since the project is component base. Each component come with three files, a typescript file that represent the class file where the logic is built, a html file that represent the template, and a CSS file for styling that template. 
The backend used a NoSQL database like MongoDB because both the front end and the backed used json, a JavaScript object notation to represent data. Mongo DB data can be indexed efficiently, and mongo allow real-time integration and ad-hoc queries.
The JSON is a just a ways of representing data which is mostly used for data communication. 
In the project I refractor the static html to handlebar, that process allow to make the application more dynamic, to bind the data easily.
This project allow me to learn about nodejs, and the other technologies put together to build complex application from start to finish.
