Two type of frontend development we used in this project are express html and angular Single Page Application. Either of these frameworks can be used to build the project. The similarity between them is that they both used JavaScript in the frontend. Angular used typescript, which still JavaScript but more focused on the data type, another similarity is that they all support the MVC pattern. On the other hand, the contrast between these frameworks is that angular give developer less freedom in the structure of the project. Developer must follow the structure angular project should be build, since the project is component base. Each component come with three files, a typescript file that represent the class file where the logic is built, a html file that represent the template, and a CSS file for styling that template. 
The backend used a NoSQL database like MongoDB because both the front end and the backed used json, a JavaScript object notation to represent data. Mongo DB data can be indexed efficiently, and mongo allow real-time integration and ad-hoc queries.
JSON is different from JavaScript, because JavaScript is a programing language, which allow Developers to build a full functioning application, but JSON is a just a ways of representing data which is mostly used for data communication. 
In the project we refractor the static html to handlebar, that process allow to make the application more dynamic, to bind the data easily.
This course helps me learn full stack development and allow understand and different technologies can be put together to build complex application from start to finish. 



The methods endpoint define how user can access resources, with path to use and what information should me return. Adding security to application will grant permission to some authorize users to access resources and denied other that are not granted access. That situation make data secure and not accessible to anyone that request them.
